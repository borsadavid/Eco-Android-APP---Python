This application runs after installing Kivy Framework.
It's an Android application where you can create your user and add points of interest on the map of Timisoara. 
Every marker has specific details about what's happening at that location, user that created the activity and specific coordinates.
There is a list of all activities.
Completing other users activities will give points based on a streak.
With points you can buy potential rewards.
